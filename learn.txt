## What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that combines:
- **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from a knowledge base
- **Generation**: Using an LLM to generate answers based on retrieved information

### Why Use RAG?

Traditional LLMs have limitations:
- ❌ Knowledge cutoff dates
- ❌ Can't access private/new documents
- ❌ May hallucinate facts

RAG solves these by:
- ✅ Accessing up-to-date, private documents
- ✅ Grounding responses in actual data
- ✅ Providing source citations

---

## System Overview

Your RAG system follows this architecture:

```
📄 PDF Upload → 🔄 Text Extraction → ✂️ Chunking → 🧮 Embeddings → 🗄️ Vector DB
                                                                         ↓
🤖 LLM Response ← 📝 Prompt Creation ← 🔍 Similarity Search ← ❓ User Question
```

### Core Components

1. **PDF Processor** (`pdf_processor.py`) - Extracts text from PDFs
2. **Vector Store** (`vector_store.py`) - Manages embeddings and search
3. **RAG System** (`rag_system.py`) - Orchestrates retrieval and generation
4. **FastAPI Server** (`main.py`) - Provides web API interface

## Component Deep Dive

### 1. PDF Processor (`pdf_processor.py`)

**Purpose**: Convert PDF files into machine-readable text.

#### How it Works:

```python
class PDFProcessor:
    def extract_text_from_pdf(self, pdf_file) -> str:
        # 1. Create a PDF reader object
        pdf_reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(pdf_file)
        
        # 2. Iterate through each page
        text = ""
        for page_num in range(len(pdf_reader.pages)):
            page = pdf_reader.pages[page_num]
            # 3. Extract text from each page
            text += page.extract_text() + "\n"
        
        return text.strip()
```

**Step-by-step process**:
1. **Input**: PDF file (binary data)
2. **Processing**: PyPDF2 reads PDF structure and extracts text
3. **Output**: Raw text string containing all document content

**Learning Note**: PDFs store text in complex formats. PyPDF2 handles the technical details of parsing PDF structure to extract readable text.

### 2. Vector Store (`vector_store.py`)

**Purpose**: Convert text into searchable vectors and manage the knowledge base.

#### Key Concepts:

**Text Chunking**:
```python
self.text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(
    chunk_size=1000,      # Each chunk ~1000 characters
    chunk_overlap=200,    # 200 character overlap between chunks
    length_function=len,
)
```

**Why Chunking?**
- LLMs have context limits
- Smaller chunks = more precise retrieval
- Overlap ensures context isn't lost at boundaries

**Embeddings**:
```python
# Convert text to numerical vectors
self.embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
embedding = self.embeddings.embed_query(chunk)
```

**What are Embeddings?**
- Vector representations of text meaning
- Similar texts have similar vectors
- Enable semantic similarity search

#### Data Storage Process:

1. **Document Input**: Raw extracted text
2. **Text Splitting**: Break into ~1000 character chunks with 200 char overlap
3. **Embedding Generation**: Convert each chunk to 384-dimensional vector
4. **Database Storage**: Store vectors + metadata in ChromaDB

#### Search Process:

1. **Query Input**: User question
2. **Query Embedding**: Convert question to vector
3. **Similarity Search**: Find most similar document vectors
4. **Results**: Return top-k most relevant text chunks

---

### 3. RAG System (`rag_system.py`)

**Purpose**: Orchestrate the retrieval and generation process.

#### The RAG Pipeline:

```python
def query(self, question: str, k: int = 5) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # STEP 1: RETRIEVAL
    retrieved_docs = self.vector_store.similarity_search(question, k=k)
    
    # STEP 2: CONTEXT PREPARATION
    context = self._prepare_context(retrieved_docs)
    
    # STEP 3: PROMPT CREATION
    prompt = self._create_prompt(question, context)
    
    # STEP 4: GENERATION
    response = self.llm.invoke(prompt)
    
    return {"answer": response.content, "sources": sources}
```

#### Detailed Steps:

**Step 1: Retrieval**
- Takes user question
- Searches vector database for similar content
- Returns top-k most relevant chunks

**Step 2: Context Preparation**
- Combines retrieved chunks into context
- Maintains chunk boundaries and metadata
- Ensures context fits within LLM limits

**Step 3: Prompt Engineering**
```python
def _create_prompt(self, question: str, context: str) -> str:
    prompt = f"""You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided context.

Context from documents:
{context}

Question: {question}

Instructions:
- Answer based ONLY on the provided context
- If the context doesn't contain relevant information, say so
- Be specific and cite relevant parts of the context
- Provide a clear, well-structured answer

Answer:"""
    return prompt
```

**Step 4: Generation**
- Sends prompt to Google Gemini LLM
- LLM generates response based on context
- Returns structured answer with sources

### 4. FastAPI Server (`main.py`)

**Purpose**: Provide web API interface for the RAG system.

#### Key Endpoints:

**Upload PDF** (`/upload-pdf`):
```python
@app.post("/upload-pdf")
async def upload_pdf(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    # 1. Read PDF file
    content = await file.read()
    
    # 2. Extract text
    text = pdf_processor.extract_text_from_bytes(content)
    
    # 3. Add to vector store
    doc_id = vector_store.add_document(text, metadata={"filename": file.filename})
    
    return {"document_id": doc_id, "filename": file.filename}
```

**Query Documents** (`/query`):
```python
@app.post("/query")
async def query_documents(request: QueryRequest):
    # Use RAG system to answer question
    result = rag_system.query(request.question, k=request.max_results)
    return result
```

## Data Flow Walkthrough

Let's trace a complete example through your system:

### Scenario: Uploading and Querying a Research Paper

#### Phase 1: Document Upload

**User Action**: Uploads "machine_learning_paper.pdf"

**System Process**:
1. **API Receives File**: FastAPI gets PDF bytes
2. **Text Extraction**: PDFProcessor extracts text
   ```
   "Introduction to Neural Networks
   Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neural networks...
   Deep learning has revolutionized machine learning by enabling..."
   ```
3. **Text Chunking**: VectorStore splits into chunks:
   ```
   Chunk 1: "Introduction to Neural Networks Neural networks are computational..."
   Chunk 2: "...computational models inspired by biological neural networks. These models..."
   Chunk 3: "Deep learning has revolutionized machine learning by enabling..."
   ```
4. **Embedding Generation**: Each chunk → 384-dimensional vector
   ```
   Chunk 1: [0.1, -0.3, 0.7, ..., 0.2]  # 384 numbers
   Chunk 2: [0.2, -0.1, 0.9, ..., 0.1]
   Chunk 3: [0.3, -0.4, 0.8, ..., 0.3]
   ```
5. **Database Storage**: Vectors stored in ChromaDB with metadata

#### Phase 2: Querying

**User Question**: "What is deep learning?"

**System Process**:

1. **Question Embedding**: Convert question to vector
   ```
   "What is deep learning?" → [0.3, -0.2, 0.8, ..., 0.2]
   ```

2. **Similarity Search**: Find closest document vectors
   ```
   Most similar chunks:
   - Chunk 3 (similarity: 0.85): "Deep learning has revolutionized..."
   - Chunk 1 (similarity: 0.72): "Introduction to Neural Networks..."
   ```

3. **Context Preparation**: Combine relevant chunks
   ```
   Context: "Deep learning has revolutionized machine learning by enabling...
            Introduction to Neural Networks Neural networks are computational..."
   ```

4. **Prompt Creation**:
   ```
   "You are a helpful assistant that answers questions based on the provided context.
   
   Context from documents:
   Deep learning has revolutionized machine learning by enabling...
   Introduction to Neural Networks Neural networks are computational...
   
   Question: What is deep learning?
   
   Answer:"
   ```

5. **LLM Generation**: Gemini generates response
   ```
   "Based on the provided context, deep learning is a revolutionary approach in 
   machine learning that has transformed the field by enabling more sophisticated 
   computational models inspired by biological neural networks..."
   ```

6. **Response**: Return answer with sources

## Technical Implementation Details

### Vector Similarity Mathematics

**Cosine Similarity**: Measures angle between vectors
```python
def cosine_similarity(vec1, vec2):
    dot_product = np.dot(vec1, vec2)
    magnitude1 = np.linalg.norm(vec1)
    magnitude2 = np.linalg.norm(vec2)
    return dot_product / (magnitude1 * magnitude2)
```

**Why Cosine Similarity?**
- Range: -1 to 1 (1 = identical, 0 = unrelated, -1 = opposite)
- Ignores vector magnitude, focuses on direction
- Perfect for text similarity

### Embedding Model Details

**all-MiniLM-L6-v2**:
- 384-dimensional vectors
- ~22M parameters
- Optimized for semantic similarity
- Fast inference (~1ms per text)

### ChromaDB Architecture

**In-Memory Storage**:
- Vectors stored in RAM for fast access
- Automatic persistence to disk
- Efficient similarity search algorithms
- Metadata filtering capabilities
